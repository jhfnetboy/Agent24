name: org-sync
description: "Sync and display organization-level context: blueprint, components, dependencies, and cross-repo status. Use /org-sync to check org status, or /org-sync init to set up your org."
---

You manage the **organization-level shared context** system. This ensures every project's agent knows the big picture, its role, and its dependencies.

Command: $ARGUMENTS

## File Locations

All org context lives in `~/.claude/org/` (global, not committed to any repo):

```
~/.claude/org/
├── blueprint.md          ← Vision, architecture, how pieces fit together (< 2000 tokens)
├── components.yaml       ← Registry of all components with dependencies
└── status.md             ← Auto-generated status snapshot (ephemeral, regeneratable)
```

**Important:** Org context is NEVER injected into project CLAUDE.md files. It's read on-demand by skills that need it. This avoids leaking local paths into committed files.

## Commands

### `/org-sync` (no args) — Show Current Context

1. Read `~/.claude/org/blueprint.md` — summarize big picture
2. Read `~/.claude/org/components.yaml` — parse component registry
3. Match current working directory to a component (compare `cwd` with `local_path` values)
4. Show this project's upstream/downstream and their status

Output:
```
## Org Context: {org name}

**Blueprint:** {one-line vision}
**Current component:** {name} — {role}

| Direction | Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| upstream | {name} | {status} | {notes} |
| downstream | {name} | {status} | {notes} |
```

If org context doesn't exist, suggest running `/org-sync init`.

### `/org-sync init` — Initialize Org Context

1. Ask for: org name, one-sentence vision
2. Ask for: first component (this repo) — name, role, description
3. Create `~/.claude/org/` directory (use Bash: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/org`)
4. Write `blueprint.md` and `components.yaml` with initial content
5. Guide user to add more components with `/org-sync add`

### `/org-sync add` — Add a Component

1. Ask for: component name, repo URL, local path (optional), description, role
2. Ask for: upstream dependencies (list of component names), downstream dependents
3. Read existing `components.yaml`, append the new component
4. Update `blueprint.md` component list if needed

**Path validation:** If `local_path` is provided, verify it exists using `test -d` before adding. Store paths as-is (the user is responsible for correct paths). Never interpolate paths into unquoted shell commands.

### `/org-sync update` — Refresh Status

For each component in `components.yaml` that has a `local_path`:
1. Verify the path exists: `test -d "{path}"` (always double-quote paths)
2. If exists: `git -C "{path}" log --oneline -3` (always double-quote)
3. Write findings to `~/.claude/org/status.md`

**Security:** Always double-quote all paths in shell commands. Never construct commands by string concatenation with unvalidated input. Use the Read tool to read YAML instead of parsing with shell commands.

### `/org-sync check {component}` — Deep Check One Component

1. Find component in `components.yaml`
2. If `local_path` exists, read its CLAUDE.md, README.md, and check recent git activity
3. Report health: recent commits, test status, open issues

## Blueprint Format

Keep under 2000 tokens. This is loaded into context by other skills.

```markdown
# {Org Name}

## Vision
{One paragraph — what the org is building}

## Architecture
{How pieces fit together — data flow, dependency layers}
{Use a simple ASCII diagram if helpful}

## Components
{Brief role of each — one line per component, NOT duplicating components.yaml}

## Shared Resources
- Contracts: {repo url}
- SDK: {repo url}
- Docs: {url}
```

## Components Registry Format

```yaml
org: "{org name}"
schema_version: 1

components:
  component-name:
    repo: "https://github.com/org/repo"
    local_path: "/absolute/path/to/repo"   # optional, must be absolute
    description: "What this component does"
    role: "Brief role in the system"
    status: "active"                        # active | wip | planned | deprecated
    upstream:                               # component names this depends on
      - other-component
    downstream:                             # component names that depend on this
      - another-component

shared:
  contracts_repo: "https://github.com/org/contracts"
  sdk_repo: "https://github.com/org/sdk"
```

## Gotchas

- **Don't inject org context into CLAUDE.md.** Org data is local/global only. Committing it leaks paths and creates merge conflicts across team members.
- **Don't use `~` in local_path.** Use absolute paths (`/Users/...` or `/home/...`). Tilde expansion is unreliable in many contexts.
- **Always quote paths in shell commands.** `git -C "/path/with spaces"` not `git -C /path/with spaces`. This prevents both breakage and injection.
- **Don't parse YAML with shell tools.** Use the Read tool to read `components.yaml`, then parse the content. Never `cat | grep` YAML.
- **Keep blueprint under 2000 tokens.** It's loaded by /evolve on every cycle. If it's too long, it wastes context budget.
- **status.md is ephemeral.** It can be deleted and regenerated anytime. Don't put important decisions there.
- **Dependencies are component names, not paths.** Always reference by the key in `components:`, never by path or URL.

## Integration

- `/evolve` reads `blueprint.md` in Phase 0 to understand project boundaries
- `/evaluate` uses org context for architecture dimension scoring
- All three skills share the same memory system in `~/.claude/memory/`
